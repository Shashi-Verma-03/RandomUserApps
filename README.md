# React 18 TypeScript Assignment

This repository contains a **React 18 application developed using TypeScript (.tsx)**, created as part of a technical assignment.  
The project demonstrates practical experience with **modern React concepts**, **API integration**, **state management using hooks**, and **deployment using GitHub Pages**.

---

## Project Summary

The application fetches user data from a given API endpoint and displays the user’s **full name** and **email address**.  
Data is handled asynchronously, stored in **localStorage**, and refreshed at the component level without triggering a page reload.

This project follows **clean code practices**, **type safety**, and **React best practices**, making it suitable for production-ready frontend applications.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- React 18 with Functional Components
- TypeScript with strict typings
- API integration using Axios
- Async/Await for asynchronous operations
- React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Component-level state refresh
- Browser Local Storage handling
- GitHub Pages deployment

---

## Assignment Requirements Implemented

- Fetch user data using an npm-based library (Axios)
- Handle API calls using async/await
- Destructure API responses and extract required fields
- Persist data in localStorage
- Implement a Refresh button to re-fetch data without page reload
- Build the application using `.tsx` with proper TypeScript typings
- Follow modular and readable project structure

---

## Tech Stack

---

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn
- GitHub account

---

## Create Project

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
cd my-app
npm start


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys the production build to GitHub Pages and makes the application publicly accessible.
